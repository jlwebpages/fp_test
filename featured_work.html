         I am surrounded by rolling hills that lead into southern California mountain ranges. After years of drought, abundant rainfall produced lush green growth. Not far from these hills is the endless California coastline. I’ve created several series of paintings that represent my experiences this diverse and changing  environment.<br>
         All pieces are acrylic and mixed media. To inquire about pricing or for more information, please <a class="e-mail" href="mailto:dkclaguna@gmail.com?subject=Darlene Laguna Art">email</a> me.

         After I finished this diptych, this song by Woodie Guthrie popped into my head. As I looked at the random drips, I thought about how our environment has been impacted by our presence and the difficult state our country is in. I hope we all think carefully about what we want to do with our land.

         I took a hike one damp morning in the spring and found myself in a misty wonderland of wild, saturated flora.

         Every day I view the hills and the sky above. They are an ongoing source of joy and inspiration as they change in color throughout the year.

         On the coast, the bright sunlight desaturates and bleaches many of the surfaces it touches. At the beach, space and textures can feel amplified.

         I often hike along the edge of an immense arroyo with a large open sky overhead. After rains, the arroyo fills and the water runs quickly. The ravens keep me company and remind me to keep my eye on the big picture.

         When I look out at the hills, I see areas meet and connect, reveal and hide. Colors, textures, spaces are juxtaposed -  sometimes in surprising ways.
