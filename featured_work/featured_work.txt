I am surrounded by rolling hills that lead into southern California mountain ranges. After years of drought, abundant rainfall produced lush green growth. Not far from these hills is the endless California coastline. Iâ€™ve created several series of paintings that represent my experiences this diverse and changing environment.

All pieces are acrylic and mixed media.
