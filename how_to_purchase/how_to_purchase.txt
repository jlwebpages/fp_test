To inquire about pricing or if you want more information, please <a class="e-mail" href="mailto:dkclaguna@gmail.com?subject=Darlene Laguna Art">email</a> me. I can provide more detailed photographs for any pieces you are interested in. Also, if you are in the Orange, CA area, you have the option to view or purchase in person.

All pieces on cradled wood panel or canvas come ready to hang with hanging hardware. Framing options for many of these are also available. The 12-inch square pieces on wood panels do not come with hanging hardware, but you can choose to receive your piece carefully set in a wood frame and ready to hang. Please <a class="e-mail" href="mailto:dkclaguna@gmail.com?subject=Darlene Laguna Art">email</a> me for specific frame options and pricing.

Shipping cost will vary depending on location.
