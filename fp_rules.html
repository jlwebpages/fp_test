<b><u>GENERAL RULES</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
If a player plays in the regular season, then he/she must also play in the postseason.
<p>
</li>

<li>
If a player quits at any time before the end of the postseason, that player still has to pay and is subject to being excluded from the Football Pool in the future.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Money isn't collected from or paid out to any player until the end of the postseason.
<p>
</li>

</ol>

<b><u>REGULAR SEASON RULES</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
The cost for each player is <b><font class="green_color">$3</font></b> per week.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you have to pick the winner (<b><font class="red_color">H</font></b>ome or <b><font class="red_color">V</font></b>isitor) of each game.  Then, you have to assign a weight to each game.  Start by assigning a weight of <b><font class="red_color">16</font></b> to the game you have the most confidence in.  Then, assign a weight of <b><font class="red_color">15</font></b> to the game you have the next most confidence in and so on, until you've assigned a weight to every game.  You also have to predict the total points of the last game listed on the Input Form.  If needed, this will be used as a tiebreaker.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, the player with the highest score wins <b><font class="green_color">$31</font></b>.  Scores are calculated by adding the weights of each player's winning picks (a game ending in a tie counts as a loss).  If two or more players tie, then their total points predications will be used to break the tie.  The player whose total points prediction comes closest to the actual total points wins.  If this is a tie, then the player whose total points prediction is less than the actual total points wins.  If a tie can't be broken because two or more players have the exact same total points prediction, then they split the <b><font class="green_color">$31</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
At the end of the regular season, the player with the highest average score wins <b><font class="green_color">$54</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$54</font></b>.  The player with the second highest average score wins <b><font class="green_color">$36</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$36</font></b>.  Each player's low score is thrown out of the average score calculation.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Wednesday night at 8:00 PM Pacific Time</font></b>.  If there's no Thursday Night game, then you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Friday night at 8:00 PM Pacific Time</font></b>.  You can resubmit your picks as many times as you want as long as I receive them before the deadline.  I’ll always use your latest submission.  If you don't submit your picks on time, you'll receive a score of "<b><font class="red_color">0</font></b>" and you still have to pay.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b><u>NOTE</u></b>:&nbsp&nbspIf you don't submit your picks on time and the Football Pool website hasn't been updated yet, then you <i><b><font class="red_color">might</font></b></i> still have a chance to get your picks in.  However, once the Football Pool website's been updated, all bets are off.

<b><u>POSTSEASON RULES</u>:</b>

<ol class="dark_blue_color">

<li>
The cost for each player is <b><font class="green_color">$10</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week you have to pick the winner (<b><font class="red_color">H</font></b>ome or <b><font class="red_color">V</font></b>isitor) and predict the margin of victory of each game.  You also have to predict the total points of the last game listed on the Input Form.  If needed, this will be used as a tiebreaker.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, the player with the lowest score wins <b><font class="green_color">$10</font></b>.  Scores are calculated by adding the difference between the predicted margin of victory and the actual margin of victory of each game.  A penalty of 7 points will also be applied for each incorrect pick.  If two or more players tie, then their total points predications will be used to break the tie.  The player whose total points prediction comes closest to the actual total points wins.  If this is a tie, then the player whose total points prediction is less than the actual total points wins.  If a tie can't be broken because two or more players have the exact same total points prediction, then they split the <b><font class="green_color">$10</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Since six games are played on Wild Card Weekend (week 1), scores for the Divisional Playoffs (week 2), Conference Championships (week 3), and Super Bowl (week 4) are scaled up to be on par with week 1.  Scores for week 2 are multiplied by 1.5, scores for week 3 are multiplied by 3, and scores for week 4 are multiplied by 6.
<p>
</li>

<li>
At the end of the postseason, the player with the lowest overall combined score wins <b><font class="green_color">$60</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$60</font></b>.  The player with the second lowest overall combined score wins <b><font class="green_color">$20</font></b>.  Any ties split the <b><font class="green_color">$20</font></b>.
<p>
</li>

<li>
Each week, you need to submit your picks by <b><font class="red_color">Friday night at 8:00 PM Pacific Time</font></b>.  You can resubmit your picks as many times as you want as long as I receive them before the deadline.  I’ll always use your latest submission.  If you don't submit your picks on time, you'll receive a blank score and you'll be out of the running for the best overall combined score.
