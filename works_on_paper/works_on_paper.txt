<span id="sub_title" class="sub_title">WORKS ON PAPER</span>

These works on paper spring from my contact with nature when I am hiking. I am often surrounded by wild, unkempt, and haphazard growth - although the trails are tended, much of the off-trail areas are left to grow freely. I see (and often hear and feel) natural texture, line, movement, design, and color.

All works on paper come matted in a white mat and ready to slip into a frame.
