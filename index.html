I am inspired by the landscape that surrounds me and the photographs I take while hiking. I use acrylic paints, a variety of mark making tools, and collage. I like to explore that moment when I decide to take a photo - what precisely catches my attention? Is it a feeling? a color? a juxtaposition of textures?  All of my work results from my experiences engaging with the world around me, and although it may appear abstract, it is based in my reality, and I hope it connects to you in a special way. </td>
