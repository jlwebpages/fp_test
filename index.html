         Thank you for taking a look at my work.<br><br>I am a mixed media and photo artist in  Orange, CA. I am inspired by the landscape that surrounds me and the photographs I take while hiking. I use acrylic paints, a variety of mark making tools, and collage. I like to explore that moment when I decide to take a photo - what precisely catches my attention? Is it a feeling? a color? a juxtaposition of textures?  All of my work results from my experiences engaging with the world around me, and although it may appear abstract, it is based in my reality, and I hope it connects to you in a special way.<br><br>If you are interested in making a purchase or have any questions, please use the form in CONTACT or email me at dkclaguna@gmail.com.<br><br>You can also connect to my Instagram account below.<br><br>If you are in the Orange, CA area, you can view or purchase in person - just contact me so we can set up a meeting at your convenience.<br><br>Thank you,<br>Darlene Laguna
