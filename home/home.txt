Thank you for taking a look at my work.
<p>
I am a mixed media and photo artist in Orange, CA. I am inspired by the landscape that surrounds me and the photographs I take while hiking. I use acrylic paints, a variety of mark making tools, and collage. I like to explore that moment when I decide to take a photo - what precisely catches my attention? Is it a feeling? a color? a juxtaposition of textures? All of my work results from my experiences engaging with the world around me, and although it may appear abstract, it is based in my reality, and I hope it connects to you in a special way.
